      <p>I am a mortgage banking professional with 6 years of origination experience primarily in the closing department. I have worked in positions such as Closing Manager, Sr. Funder, Closing Lead, QC, and Closing Trainer. </p>

      <p>In my position as Sr. Funder I typically manage a pipeline of 70-90 loans per month, while actively leading the closing team, ensuring deadlines are met from initial closing disclosure to loan purchase. At the time of purchase, I assist with investor suspense items and reconciliation which has enabled me to obtain knowledge regarding post-closing and investor loan purchases. </p>

      <p>Many tasks came along with the latter, such as ensuring the purchase ability of the loan to investors, whether it is by reconciling the file with processing or even underwriting to ensure proper purchase of the loan. Further, I ensure a smooth purchasing process to prevent loans from not being purchased by investors and/or limiting the companyâ€™s liability to redrawing loan documents as often possible. </p>
